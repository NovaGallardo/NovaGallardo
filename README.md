👋 Hi, I'm Nova Gallardo!

I kicked off my career in the creative world with a Bachelor's in Audiovisual Communication and Interactive Media. 🎥 My passion for storytelling and problem-solving led me to master video editing and 2D animation, working with a variety of advanced software tools. This experience sparked my interest in how technology and data can drive creativity and strategy. 💡

Currently, I'm diving deeper into this passion through the Data Analyst program at Laboratoria Bootcamp, where I'm sharpening my skills in Python, SQL, and Power BI. 📊 The bootcamp is equipping me with the tools to blend my technical skills with my creative background, enabling me to turn data into actionable insights.

Alongside my studies, I’m applying my growing expertise at La Victoria Lab, where I manage technical support and work with Google Workspace. 🛠️ This hands-on experience is reinforcing my passion for data analysis and my goal of fully transitioning into this field.

I’m excited to continue my journey in data analysis and to use my skills to generate insights that support strategic decision-making. 🚀

When I'm not diving into data, you’ll find me surfing waves 🌊 or exploring new tech trends. 🧠
